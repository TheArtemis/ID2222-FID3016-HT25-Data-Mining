Subject: Weekend Plans

Hey Sarah,

Hope you're doing great! I wanted to ask if you're free this weekend for a hiking trip. The weather looks perfect and I found a great trail we haven't explored yet. Let me know if you're interested and we can plan the details together. It should be a lot of fun!

Talk soon,
Mike
